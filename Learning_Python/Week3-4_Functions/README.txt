Week 3-4: Functions and Basic Concepts

Practice these concepts:
1. Functions
   - Function definition and parameters
   - Return values
   - Default arguments
   - *args and **kwargs

2. Scope
   - Local vs Global variables
   - The global keyword
   - Variable lifetime

3. List Comprehension
   - Basic list comprehension
   - Conditional list comprehension
   - Nested list comprehension

4. Error Handling
   - try/except blocks
   - Multiple except blocks
   - finally clause
   - Custom exceptions

5. File Handling
   - Reading files
   - Writing files
   - Working with CSV files
   - File modes and operations

6. Modules and Imports (optional but recommended)
   - Using built-in modules (math, random, os)
   - Creating and importing your own module

7. Basic Debugging (optional but useful)
  - Using print() statements
  - Intro to debugging tools (pdb or IDE debugger)
8. Activities & Projects to Hone Skills

Activities
  - Re-implement earlier Week 1â€“2 exercises using functions.
  - Daily practice with list comprehensions (generate lists in one line).
  - Error-handling drills: break your own code on purpose and fix it.
  - File practice: make a diary app that writes your daily entry into a file.
Projects

  - Functions for add, subtract, multiply, divide.
  - Handle invalid inputs and division by zero.
To-Do List App (File-Based)
  - Save/load tasks in a text file.
  - Add/remove tasks with functions.
Student Grades Manager (CSV)
